My research interests liens computational harmonic analysis, convex optimization, scientific computing and their intersection, applied to sparse recovery and inverse problems. This interest began when I did a final project for my fourier analysis course in compressed sensing, and in a later course on inverse problems in matrix completion and robust PCA.

My current Msc project in the problem of Super-Resolution of point sources: To recover a sparse point measure from low-frequency information, which can be cast as a infinite-dimensional optimization problem in the space of complex-valued measures and minimizing the total variation norm. 

Several approaches has been proposed to solve this problem, most prominently: For the case of Fourier type-kernels, leveraging convex duality, the dual problem can be cast a a SDP problem, which can be solved using available solvers, but doesn't translate well to higher dimensions and other types of kernels. For traslation-invariants and twice differentiable, there exists (Sliding) Frank-Wolfe type methods in measure spaces to solve this problem.
