My research interests lies in computational harmonic analysis, convex optimization, scientific computing and their intersection, applied to sparse recovery, inverse problems and data science. This interest began when I did a final project for my fourier analysis course in compressed sensing, and in a later course in matrix completion and robust PCA.
